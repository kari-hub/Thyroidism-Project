# Hypothyroidism-Project

## Overview

This project analyzes data collected by Nairobi Hospital during a clinical camp focused on hypothyroidism testing. The dataset includes information on thyroid patients and aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patientâ€™s symptoms indicate hypothyroidism.

The objective is to apply various machine learning models and techniques to determine if the patient has hypothyroidism based on their medical data.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before building the models, we perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset, visualize relationships between features, and check for missing or unusual data.

### 2. Part 1: Decision Trees
In this section, we build a predictive model using ensemble methods, rather than individual decision trees. We test the following models:
- **Random Forests**: An ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy.
- **AdaBoosted Trees**: A boosting technique that focuses on misclassified instances to improve model performance.
- **Gradient-Boosted Trees**: A boosting algorithm that optimizes the model by correcting errors in sequential stages.

### 3. Part 2: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
For this part, we apply Support Vector Machines (SVM) with three different kernel functions:
- **Polynomial Kernel**
- **Linear Kernel**
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**

We evaluate the performance of each kernel function and select the best-performing one. After selecting the best kernel, we fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and make predictions using additional features to further improve accuracy.

## Dataset Columns
The dataset contains the following columns that describe the patients' characteristics:

- **Age**: The age of the patient.
- **Sex**: Gender of the patient.
- **on_thyroxine**: Whether the patient is currently taking thyroxine medication.
- **query_on_thyroxine**: Whether the patient has ever inquired about thyroxine medication.
- **on_antithyroid_medication**: Whether the patient is on antithyroid medication.
- **thyroid_surgery**: Whether the patient has had thyroid surgery.
- **query_hypothyroid**: Whether the patient has inquired about hypothyroidism.
- **query_hyperthyroid**: Whether the patient has inquired about hyperthyroidism.
- **pregnant**: Whether the patient is pregnant.
- **sick**: Whether the patient is currently sick.
- **tumour**: Whether the patient has a tumor.
- **lithium**: Whether the patient is on lithium medication.
- **goitre**: Whether the patient has a goitre (enlarged thyroid).
- **TSH_measured**: Whether the patient's TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) levels were measured.
- **TSH**: The level of TSH in the patient's blood.
- **T3_measured**: Whether the patient's T3 levels were measured.
- **T3**: The level of T3 in the patient's blood.
- **TT4_measured**: Whether the patient's TT4 (Total T4) levels were measured.
- **TT4**: The level of TT4 in the patient's blood.
